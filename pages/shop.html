            Headery.™ was formulated (with you in mind) to maintain the benefits of balanced wellbeing from morning to night. Headery’s all natural blends adapt to your unique needs to maintain wellbeing around the clock.

            Rooted in Denver, our commitment to the customer is plant-based solutions backed by modern science which can help support us through our day-to-day lives. We only source from non-GMO, certified farms with testing done by Botanacor and ProVerde. 
            
            We believe that by balancing the relationship between mental, physical and emotional wellbeing we are connected to our natural state and the non-psychoactive, stabilizing benefits of supported wellbeing. Without the use of harmful chemicals. 
            
            We are a small and lean team, who are committed to the vision of a sustainable and budding community filled with individuals who feel supported by Headery.
            
            For every bottle purchased, the monetary equivalent of 1 bottle will be pledged through our research partnership with Mcmaster University, pioneering the way for science-based CBD education.
